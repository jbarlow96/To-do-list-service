12/19 - Started Project

12/28 - FRONTEND:
            [WDS] Disconnected!
            close @ client:177
            client:174 Invalid Host/Origin header
            error @ client:174
            client:177
      These errors just keep going... but the frontend still works.
      
12/28 - FRONTEND:
        Created a 'getTasks' function to return the tasks that currently exists, but get an error saying that 'getTasks' is not a function.
        FIXED: forgot to write the async keyword, but now am getting a 'CORS' error
        FIXED Cors error, ran into this same problem while creating a react webapp for my database class this previous semester.
