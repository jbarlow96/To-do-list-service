12/19 - Started Project

12/20 - Used Postman to test backend requests.... successfully created functional API that fulfilled most of the requirements.

12/28 - FRONTEND:
            [WDS] Disconnected!
            close @ client:177
            client:174 Invalid Host/Origin header
            error @ client:174
            client:177
      These 2 errors just keep going repeatedly...
      
12/28 - FRONTEND:
        Created a 'getTasks' function to return the tasks that currently exists, but get an error saying that 'getTasks' is not a function.
        FIXED: forgot to write the async keyword, but now am getting a 'CORS' error
        FIXED Cors error, ran into this same problem while creating a react webapp for my database class this previous semester.

12/30 - Having trouble understanding the post, update and delete in ts. What goes in the component.ts and service.ts had me troubled the most.
12/30 - Nick dared me to make loading icon appear after clicking on buttons... 12/31 - The loading animation is sitting in the "get tasks" button instead of occuring after clicking it.

Typescript - I handled the typescript well in the backend portion of this project mainly because I handled the backend portion of the database project involving mysql with node and express. As for the frontend portion, what really confused me about angular/typescript was how to apply it to a service and component file and connect it to the html.

After doing this project, I realized that I am far more comfortable working with the backend portion of it. However, I also want to teach myself/experiment more with angular. Also, due to the time of the year and how much it impacted my schedule, I was unfortunately unable to work on this as much as I wished. Nick and I share a Udemy account, so I used that to help me out with Docker and Angular. Unfortunately I was unable to get deep into the angular course due to time constraints.
